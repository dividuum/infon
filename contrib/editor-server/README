Infon Editor-Server v0.1 (2007-06-10)
By Moritz 'Nudelbrotsuppe' Kroll <Moritz.Kroll@gmx.de>

The Editor-Server is a server for the Infon SDL client (it may work for
other Infon clients, too) which allows for creating new maps.

Compiling:
 Just type 'make'.

Command line description:
 Usage: editor-server [options]
 Options:
   -w <width>        Sets the width of the map (default: 40)
   -h <height>       Sets the height of the map (default: 30)
   -o <outputfile>   Sets the name of the output file (default: "testmap.lua")

Editing:
 After pressing F11 to enable input forwarding, you can draw on the map with
 the right mouse button. The editor distinguishes three modes:
 
  - Tile mode: You can draw either solid or walkable tiles. The tiles can be
      selected in the control panel on the left side.
  - Fill mode: Fills the area defined by the tile under the mouse cursor with
      the currently selected pen tile, when you press the right mouse button.
      Fill mode can be toggled with the 'F' key, when a tile is selected as
      the current pen. In fill mode the "mode player" is highlighted.
  - Food mode: Draws food spawners on the map tiles. The food amount specifies
      how much food is added to a random point inside a 10x10 rectangle with
      the food spawner in the upper left corner after 200ms.
      The behaviour of the food spawners should probably be fine tuned in the
      generated level lua sourcecode.

 Keys ("<->" means a range of keys on the keyboard next to each other):
  - 'S':         Saves the map into the output file
  - 'F':         Toggles fill mode
  - 'C':         Clears the map after confirmation with 'Y' ('Z' on qwertz)
  - 'R' <-> 'P': Selects solid tiles
  - 'G' <-> 'K': Selects walkable tiles
