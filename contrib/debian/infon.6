\fBinfonx\fP is the graphical viewers for the infon game.
Infon is a game which simulates the live of simple bugs who eat,
propagate, eat each other and evolve. The players can not control
the bugs directly but write their "intelligence" in the simple
script language lua and upload it to the game using a plain telnet
connection. The code can then be modified even while the game
is running.

You have to specify the hostname of the server to connect to on the 
command line.
